# Documentation Folder - AI Assistant Chat History

## Initial Request

**Date:** July 4, 2025  
**Request:** Rename py_package to py-package-template in all repo files

## Context

Working with a Python package template repository that needed to be renamed from the generic `py_package` to `py-package-template` for better identification and clarity.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Repository Analysis

- Searched for all occurrences of `py_package` across the repository
- Identified files needing updates:
  - `pyproject.toml` (package configuration)
  - Python source files in `src/py_package/`
  - Test files
  - Documentation files (PlantUML and SVG)

### 2. Folder Structure Changes

- Renamed `src/py_package/` to `src/py_package_template/`
- Used underscores for Python module compatibility (hyphens not allowed in Python imports)

### 3. Configuration Updates

- Updated `pyproject.toml`:
  - Package name: `py_package` → `py-package-template` (with hyphens for PyPI)
  - Module references: `py_package` → `py_package_template` (underscores for imports)
  - GitHub URLs updated to reflect new repository name
  - File paths in version management configuration

### 4. Source Code Updates

- Updated import statements in test files
- Updated GitHub repository references in `__init__.py` and `__main__.py`
- Maintained functionality while updating naming

### 5. Documentation Updates

- Updated PlantUML source files:
  - `package_development.puml`
  - `data_science_architecture.puml`
- Updated GitHub repository references throughout documentation
- Created Mermaid diagram equivalents for both PlantUML files

## Subsequent Requests

### 2. Mermaid Diagram Creation

**Request:** Add mermaid diagram for PlantUML code

**Actions:**

- Created `package_development.md` with Mermaid equivalent of the PlantUML package development workflow
- Created `data_science_architecture.md` with Mermaid equivalent of the data science architecture
- Both diagrams include:
  - Comprehensive flowcharts with proper styling
  - Detailed documentation sections
  - GitHub-native rendering capability
  - Enhanced accessibility for team collaboration

### 3. Documentation Strategy

**Request:** For repository, add all the prompt and chat history to each top level folder in a dedicated markdown document with appropriate filename

**Current Action:** Creating dedicated documentation files in each top-level folder to maintain comprehensive project history and context.

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Naming Convention:**
   - Package name: `py-package-template` (hyphens for PyPI distribution)
   - Module name: `py_package_template` (underscores for Python compatibility)

2. **Documentation Strategy:**
   - Maintained both PlantUML (original) and Mermaid (GitHub-friendly) versions
   - Added comprehensive overview sections to Mermaid files
   - Created dedicated chat history documentation for future reference

## Files Created/Modified in docs/

### Created

- `package_development.md` - Mermaid version of package development workflow
- `data_science_architecture.md` - Mermaid version of data science architecture
- `AI_CHAT_HISTORY.md` (this file) - Complete chat history and context

### Modified

- `package_development.puml` - Updated repository references
- `data_science_architecture.puml` - Updated repository references

## Future Considerations

- This documentation pattern should be continued for all future AI-assisted changes
- Both PlantUML and Mermaid versions should be maintained for different use cases
- Consider automating diagram generation from source PlantUML files
